# Taipei MRT Passenger Flow Prediction

## Project Overview
This project aims to combine publicly available datasets to create a comprehensive dataset containing information about the number of people at each MRT station in Taipei, along with current weather data and other relevant features about the location. The ultimate goal is to utilize machine learning methods to predict the amount of people passing through each station based on these features.

## Motivation
Understanding and predicting MRT station traffic in Taipei is crucial for improving public transportation services and city planning, as well as for individual planning. By integrating data on MRT station traffic with weather conditions and other relevant features, we can develop models that provide valuable insights for optimizing MRT schedules, and resource allocation.
