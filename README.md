# Taipei Bus Stop Traffic Prediction

## Project Overview
This project aims to combine publicly available datasets to create a comprehensive dataset containing information about the number of people at each bus stop in Taipei, along with current weather data and other relevant features about the location. The ultimate goal is to utilize machine learning methods to predict the amount of people at a given bus stop based on these features.

## Motivation
Understanding and predicting bus stop traffic in Taipei is crucial for improving public transportation services and city planning. By integrating data on bus stop traffic with weather conditions and other relevant features, we can develop models that provide valuable insights for optimizing bus routes, schedules, and resource allocation.
